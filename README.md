# Recipes System

I was working on this Angular project while going through the Udemy course [Angular - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/).

## ðŸ’¡ Functionality

An anonymous user can log in or sign up. Authenticated users can browse through all recipes, view recipe details, and perform all CRUD operations on them. Users can also add recipe ingredients to the shopping list (cart) and manage it as they wish.

## ðŸ”‘ Value of the Project

This project gave me an understanding of how standalone Angular works. I learned basic concepts such as components, pipes, directives, Observables, routing, the RxJS package, and much more. I used the Firebase API to manage the Realtime Database.

## ðŸš€ Run Project

1. Run npm install to install all dependencies.
2. Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
